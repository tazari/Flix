### Notes
Surprisingly few challenges encountered upon buliding this app! The biggest was right towards the end: went to pull the ReadMe from GitHub into my XCode project and accidentally stashed away all the code in my XCode project, leaving me with a blank XCode workspace. Stashed? Stashed where? I had no idea! Eventually was able to find it under Source Control navigator > Stashed Changes folder, but for a few hours it was a sad, sad day.
